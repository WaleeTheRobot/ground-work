This is an example of how you might create an application based on https://github.com/WaleeTheRobot/strategy-analyzer-exporter. This should not be used as is since it's only an example and will probably not even work.

It includes an example of how to add the Volumetric data in the StrategyAnalyzerExporter.

It includes TradeAlpha example of calling an API. You would want to update this to a websocket connection if want more real-time data.
